                <br /><br />
                We are building a website called as LearnSomethingNew, the notion is to create a platform where people can look for different kinds of classes, search for an instructor for the skill that they want to learn and book an appointment with the instructor.
                This business is based on profit sharing basis where every time an instructor is booked, the platform gets a commission from that. The platform helps in connecting an instructor with the right audience and helps in better accessibility.
                This platform can be extended to many other services as required in day to day life.
                <br /><br />
