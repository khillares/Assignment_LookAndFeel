                <br /><br />
                We have built a website called as <b>LearnSomethingNew</b>, the notion is to create a platform where people can look for different kinds of classes, search for an instructor for the skill that they want to learn and book an appointment with the instructor.
                This business is based on profit sharing basis where every time an instructor is booked, the platform gets a commission from that. The platform helps in connecting an instructor with the right audience and helps in better accessibility.
                This platform can be extended to many other services as required in day to day life.
                <br /><br />

                <h4 style="color: maroon"><u>Responsiveness:</u></h4>
                For Responsiveness, we are using Meta Tags. The description of Meta Tags is:

                <br /> <br />
                1. Charset= UTF8, this will set character encoding to UTF8.
                <br>

                2. In second tag, viewport we are going with device width, also we are providing initial scale as 1.
                <br>

                3. In last compatible tag, we are keeping this compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer Edge version and Chrome.
                <br>
                <h4 style="color: maroon"><u>Usability:</u></h4>
                1. We have tried to keep this website simple and understandable, for that we have given
                a description on the homepage about <u>how the process</u>  works for the users. <br />
                2. For ease of usage and navigation, we have put the images of each skill
                which are <u>linked</u> to the dedicated pages of that skill. <br />
                3. In addition to this, we have put the <u>buttons</u> against each instructor to book the service of that instructor.
                Later, we will show a form on click of book button, form will be used for the user to submit his/her details, and to reach out to the instructor.

                <h4 style="color: maroon"><u>Content:</u></h4>

                We have created a homepage where all the skills are shown in the form of <u>
                    relevant images,
                </u>
                on click of image, a page for the particular skill opens up. The homepage also describes
                the process of how the website works for the users which helps the users in understanding the usability.
                <br /><br />
                On the skill pages, we have put the content and details about the skill and
                have provided details about the instructors who can be booked for service.
                As of now, we have included following skills:
                <br /><br />
                1. Zumba
                <br />
                2. Guitar
                <br />
                3. YogaFitness
                <br />
                4. Swimming
                <br />

                <br />
                6. Dance
                <br />



                <h4 style="color: maroon"><u>Design:</u></h4>

                1. For designing purpose, we have created <u>classes</u> for each tag and have mentioned those classes in the css. The styling has been kept basic and mostly worked around colors, font, different headings and alignment.<br />
                2. We have used <u>horizontal unordered list</u> to show the set of skills on the homepage, we have used <u>images</u> in place of text to show the skill.<br />
                3. We have also put some images on the top of the Homepage which includes the name of the website as well in the form of a image.<br />
                4. To show the details clearly, we have used <u>table</u> on the skill page to show instrcutor details and have used a <u>button</u> inside the table against each instructor.
                <br /><br />
                We have tried to capture following Design Guidelines:<br />
                1. Responsive Design<br />
               2. Simplicity: Easy Navigation with one click.<br />
                3. Consistency: All the pages have the  body content in the same font and color. All the headings and background color are consistent throughout the website.
